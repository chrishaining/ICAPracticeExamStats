# ICAPracticeExamStats
This is my first attempt at putting a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) project on Github. 

The project shows some statistics to help me:
* understand how effective my test-taking is
* see my progress, so that I know when I am ready to take the real test.

The variables are:
* time taken per question
* outcome for each question (i.e. whether I answered the question correctly).
